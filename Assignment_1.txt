Summary 

Karen Sternheimer thinks video games are not responsible for school shootings. 
She believes that the media has brought up irrelevant studies that generate inconclusive studies
There are other factors that are actually prevalent which the media ignores.

The media likes to say that shooters are caused by Video Games. 
However, saying that is misleading. Everyone plays video games; it’s a billion dollar industry. 
Video games sales are up, yet shootings are down. 
Keeping this in mind, those who study violence and aggressive behavior say that it would impossible to determine a correlation between the two. 
The media says that Video Games are a central cause of violence; however, they fail to mention mental illness and other considerations which could factor into the equation. 

In the 90s game critics claimed Doom would teach kids how to kill.
Then there where 3 school shootings in 3 states, all loved Doom.
The media’s explanation must have been correct, right?
However in the decades preceding Video Game sales are Eclipsing Movie sales, yet not an increase in shootings.
